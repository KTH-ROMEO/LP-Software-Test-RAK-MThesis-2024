# Tests
This folder contains simple scripts written early in the Langmuir Probe software implementation process
to test basic functionality such as UART communication, single Telecommand generation, sending and Telemetry 
verification.


Each file contains a comment at the start that gives a minimal explanation of what the test or script was used for.
