# Tests
This folder contains simple scripts written early in the Langmuir Probe software implementation process
to test basic functionality such as UART communication, single Telecommand generation, sending and Telemetry 
verification.


Each file contains a comment at the start that gives a minimal explanation of what the test or script was used for.

Tests were conducted by connecting a UART interface of the Langmuir Probe hardware to a laptop using a UART-USB cable.
Each test uses a serial connection, thus the correct serial port needs to be selected. Since the tests where run on a
MS Windows laptop the serial port used in all tests is COM3.
